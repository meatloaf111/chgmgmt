Dear {!feedback360__c.Name__c},

You have been selected by {!feedback360__c.EmployeeName__c} to participate in the Mcdonalds 360° Survey. The purpose of this survey is to provide feedback to managers or would-be managers who want to enhance their self-insight.

Please be sure to answer all questions as honestly and as accurately as you can – your feedback will remain confidential. Other than for managers rating their direct reports, all feedback is aggregated in the feedback report. Your individual ratings and comments cannot be linked back to you.
